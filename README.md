# ParkingSystem-Basic-Web-Project
I created this simple Parking System MVC application. It is my first MVC applicaton. The application holds Cars inside memory storage. The functionality of the application supports:

**• Listing Cars**

The list of cars with its makes and plate numbers looks like this:

**• Adding a Car**

You can add a car when you type the car details in the blank fields: **Make** and **Plate #**. Finally, you should simply click on **Add** button.

**• Deleting a Car**

You can delete any car you want by simply click on **Delete** button which is located next to the car details you want to remove from the list.
