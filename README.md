# ParkingSystem-Basic-Web-Project
I created this simple Parking System MVC application. It is my first MVC applicaton. The application holds Cars inside memory storage. The functionality of the application supports:

**• Listing Cars**

**• Adding a Car**

You can do this when you type car details in the blank fields: **Make** and **Plate #**. Finally, you should simply click on **Add** button.
